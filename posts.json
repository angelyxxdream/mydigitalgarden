Place them near a window so they get gentle light every day.\n\n💧 Watering: Only water when the soil looks dry or cracked. Always water the soil, not the leaves, and keep a nice rhythm — not too often!\n\n🌱 Soil: Ask your parents to use cactus soil mixed with sand or perlite. This makes the roots feel comfy.\n\n❄️ Cold Weather: In winter, bring your succulents inside at night so they don’t get too cold.\n\n🪴 Repotting: Be very gentle when moving your succulent to a new pot — the roots are delicate.\n\n🧹 Cleaning: Dust can sit on their leaves, so use a soft brush to keep them clean.\n\n🐞 Pests: If you see tiny bugs like aphids or mealybugs, ask your parents for help to treat your plant safely."
